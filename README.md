  - **Admin Mode**: Allows for editing and deleting products.
  - **User Mode**: Regular browsing and viewing of products without any modification rights.

- **State Management with Cubit**: Efficient handling of app states and logic.
- **Product Management**: Add, edit, and delete products (in admin mode).
- **API Integration**: Connected with the [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to display products.
